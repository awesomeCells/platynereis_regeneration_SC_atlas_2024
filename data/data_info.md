To download the data used for this project, please find the public accession numbers in the readme file.

xloc_blast_hits.RData contains BLAST hits for all Platynereis genes predicted on the genome annotation (see readme). This file was then used to annotate Platynereis gene IDs (xloc) with their respective BLAST hit throughout the project.

genelist.xlsx contains example genes to test the plotting functions.
